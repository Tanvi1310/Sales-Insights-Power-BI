ðŸ“Š Sales Dashboard (Power BI)

This is my first Power BI project, where I created a simple sales dashboard to explore and analyze sales data.

The dataset includes product sales details such as order date, sales amount, sales quantity, and customer information.
I used Power BI to clean the data, perform transformations, and build a dashboard for visualization.

ðŸ”§ What I Did

Cleaned and transformed raw sales data in Power Query

Created a new calculated column for Cost Price,Normalized Sales Amount etc

Built a dashboard to visualize sales insights

Gained hands-on experience in Power BI basics
